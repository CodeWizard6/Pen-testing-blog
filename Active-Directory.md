In this collection are walkthroughs based on exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Directory. I show some common vulnerabilities that are often used to compromise Active Directory such as AS-REP roasting, Kerberoasting, several of the ESC 1 - 8 attack vectors against Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) and domain sync (DCSync) attacks. Furthermore, I also demonstrate the usage of common tools used in real - world pen - testing exercises as well as by malicious actors to compromise AD environments such as Bloodhound, Impacket, and CrackMap Exec. These walkthroughs show the severe impact that exploitation can have to include full escalation of privileges to Administrator user on the AD domain.

If you like to view my work by the machines where the above vulnerabilities are exploited, please visit the links in the section Walkthroughs by OWASP Category in the site sidebar on the left. I also have written articles on how some of these vulnerabilities work that can be found under the heading Vulnerability Technical Guides in the left navigation pane.
