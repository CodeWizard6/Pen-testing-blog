In this collection are walkthroughs based on exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Directory. I show some common vulnerabilities that are often used to compromise Active Directory such as AS-REP roasting, Kerberoasting, several of the ESC 1 - 8 attack vectors against Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) and domain sync (DCSync) attacks. Furthermore, I also demonstrate the usage of common tools used in real - world pen - testing exercises as well as by malicious actors to compromise AD environments such as Bloodhound, Impacket, and CrackMap Exec. These examples show the severe impact that exploitation can cause to include full escalation of privileges to SYSTEM or ADMINISTRATOR user.

If you like to view my work by the machines where the above vulnerabilities are exploited, please visit here. I also have written articles on how some of these vulnerabilities work that can be found under the heading Vulnerability Technical Guides in the left navigation pane.
