In this collection are walkthroughs based on exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. I show some common vulnerabilities that are often used to compromise web applications such as use of vulnerable web application components, server side request forgery (SSRF), and broken authentication or access control. These examples show the severe impact that exploitation can cause to include full escalation of privileges to SYSTEM or ADMINISTRATOR user. Moreover, I demonstrate tools that are often used in real pen-testing exercises such as BurpSuite, Responder, GoBuster and NetCat.

If you like to view my work by the machines where the above vulnerabilities are exploited, please visit the vulnerabilities collection or via the corresponding link in the left navigation pane. I also have written articles on how these vulnerabilities work that can also be found under the heading Vulnerability Technical Guides in the left navigation pane.
