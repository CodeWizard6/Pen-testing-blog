        <h1>Welcome to My Pen Testing Blog!</h1>
        <p>This blog is a collection of walkthroughs of how to obtain root or Administrator role privileges on the virtual machines hosted on the HackTheBox platform 
            at HackTheBox.com. In each post, I will provide a step-by-step guide on how to obtain root or Administrator role privileges on the virtual machine and show all
            critical inputs and outputs via screenshots so you can easily follow along. The walkthroughts will follow the below format in line with the steps of a traditional
            penetration (pen) test. At the end of each walkthrough, I also include a section summarizing the vulnerabilities, methods for exploitaiton, and security controls that can mitigate
            exploitation.
                <ol>
                    <li>Enumeration</li>
                    <li>Obtaining initial foothold</li>
                    <li>Lateral movement (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>Privilege escalation</li>
                </ol>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the walkthroughs, I also write the technical details of the vulnerabilities that led to compromise such as how such vulnerabilities work and why
            exploitation is dangerous. Feel free to browse my work by individual walkthroughs in the section Individual Walkthroughs on the left sidebar navigation pane
            or view walkthroughs grouped by vulnerability in the section named walkthroughs by vulnerability. Feel free to leave a comment and I will get back to you as soon
            as possible. Enjoy and hope you learn something new!
